# Spotify Distribution Project (Start Date 01/21/2023)

## **View what the website currently looks like here! https://bchh325.github.io/spotify-distribution/**

The end goal is for users to be able to view a visualization of their genres in a given spotify playlist <br>
and interact with others who are also using the site at the same time.

## Technologies I'm planning to use
* React
* Express/Node (BFF Proxy / Auth Code Flow w/ PKCE)
* Spotify Web API
* Spotify Web Playback SDK
* WebSockets
* Database TBD
* Deployment Options TBD

## Completed Tasks
* Sample UI Design

## Planned Tasks (I always find something to add to this list)
* BFF Proxy for User Authentication
